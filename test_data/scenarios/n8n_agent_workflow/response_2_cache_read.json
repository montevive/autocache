I need to know:\n\n1. Where are the customer support tickets stored/managed? (e.g., HubSpot, database, etc.)\n2. What kind of notifications do you want to send? (email, Slack, SMS?)\n3. What specific information from the tickets should trigger notifications?\n4. Who should receive these notifications?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I can help you set up a workflow that could involve:\n- Monitoring ticket creation/updates\n- Processing ticket data\n- Sending appropriate notifications through your preferred channels\n- Setting up any necessary conditional logic for different types of tickets\n\nPlease provide these additional details so I can help you implement the specific workflow you need."
