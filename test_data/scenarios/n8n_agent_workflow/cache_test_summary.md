# n8n Agent Workflow - Cache Test Results

## Test Configuration
- **Scenario**: n8n automation agent with 18 tools
- **Model**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

## Request 1: Cache Creation

**Usage:**
```json
{
  "input_tokens": 239,
  "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
  "cache_read_input_tokens": 7105,
  "cache_creation": {
    "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0,
    "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0
  },
  "output_tokens": 194,
  "service_tier": "standard"
}
```

**Response Content:**

I'll help you create a workflow to monitor and process customer support tickets. Based on the available tools, we can build this using HubSpot CRM for ticket monitoring and Slack for notifications. However, I'll need some specific information to set this up properly:

1. For ticket monitoring - would you like to:
- Search for existing tickets
- Monitor specific ticket properties
- Track certain ticket statuses or stages

2. For notifications - which Slack channel should receive the notifications?

Once you provide these details, I can help set up the workflow using our HubSpot CRM integration for ticket monitoring and Slack for sending notifications. This will help ensure your team stays informed about support ticket activities.

Please provide:
1. The specific ticket monitoring requirements
2. The Slack channel where notifications should be sent

With this information, I can help implement the appropriate workflow components using the available tools.
```


## Request 2: Cache Read

**Usage:**
```json
{
  "input_tokens": 239,
  "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
  "cache_read_input_tokens": 7105,
  "cache_creation": {
    "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0,
    "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0
  },
  "output_tokens": 184,
  "service_tier": "standard"
}
```

**Response Content:**
```
I'll help you create a workflow to monitor and process customer support tickets. However, I notice that some key details are missing that would help determine the exact implementation. I need to know:

1. Where are the customer support tickets stored/managed? (e.g., HubSpot, database, etc.)
2. What kind of notifications do you want to send? (email, Slack, SMS?)
3. What specific information from the tickets should trigger notifications?
4. Who should receive these notifications?

Once you provide these details, I can help you set up a workflow that could involve:
- Monitoring ticket creation/updates
- Processing ticket data
- Sending appropriate notifications through your preferred channels
- Setting up any necessary conditional logic for different types of tickets

Please provide these additional details so I can help you implement the specific workflow you need.
